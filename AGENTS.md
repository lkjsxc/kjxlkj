Please bring the documentation to a fully complete state so that the project is completely ready to begin implementation. You are allowed to make bold, substantial changes. Improve it as much as possible, to the limit.

Stop creating unnatural TODOs whose purpose is merely to connect all document files, such as “doc-links.” Restructure it into a clearer, better structure so that one can simply proceed through the stages in order.

Also, completely replace every TODO that refers to directory names or links to them with something conveying the nuance of “restructure-step.” The idea is that if an AI agent follows these steps in order—checking off the checkboxes as it goes—it will result in a completed project that conforms to all documentation files.

Logs are not needed, so please delete them when preparing for the restructuring.
