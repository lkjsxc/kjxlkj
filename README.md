# kjxlkj

kjxlkj is a Neovim-inspired TUI text editor written in Rust.

This repository is "All in Docs".

This repository is optimized for machine (LLM) parsing and editing. This statement appears only here and in docs/README.md + docs/policy/README.md to avoid scattering it across leaf documents.

## Docs

- Canonical specifications: docs/spec/README.md
- Policies and invariants: docs/policy/README.md
- Documentation index: docs/README.md

## Implementation

This repository contains normative documentation only; it does not include buildable Rust source code.

The intended implementation is a single Rust binary whose architecture, runtime model, and feature set are specified under `docs/spec/`.
