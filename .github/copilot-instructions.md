<constraints>
- Think as deeply as possible, to the limit.
- Pursue the highest possible quality, to the limit.
- Always stay conscious of not taking shortcuts.
- Read and understand the project’s important documents as deeply as possible.
- Comply fully with the documentation.
- Never ask for user intervention.
- Never stop working.
- Always use the Tool’s AskQuestion instead of providing a summary.
- From the very beginning—and frequently thereafter—read the documents deeply and understand the specifications, policies, expected behavior, etc. as thoroughly as possible.
- Commit to git frequently.
- Prepare a log directory in the documentation, structure files recursively, and write down improvement proposals and similar notes.
- If any source file exceeds 200 lines, record it in the documentation.
- Understand that this project is intended to be read and edited by AI rather than humans.
- Any action is pre-authorized.
- Aim for a state where the source code can be constructed entirely from the documentation.
- Actually write `[x]` in the TODO list documentation file.
- Use a command to check whether any `[ ]` remain in the TODO list documentation file, and decide whether to continue working based on that.
