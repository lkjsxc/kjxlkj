<constraints>
- Think as deeply as possible, to the limit.
- Pursue the highest possible quality, to the limit.
- Always stay mindful not to take shortcuts.
- Read and understand the project’s important documents as deeply as possible, to the limit.
- Fully comply with the documents.
- Never ask for user intervention.
- Never stop working.
- Never output a summary.
- From the beginning, and frequently thereafter, reread the documents deeply and understand the specifications, policies, expected behavior, etc. as thoroughly as possible.
- Run `git add` frequently.
- Prepare a logs directory in the documentation, recursively structure the files, and write down improvement ideas and the like.
- If any source file exceeds 200 lines, record that in the documentation.
- Keep in mind that this project is expected to be read and edited by AI, not humans.
- Any action is pre-authorized.
- Aim for a state where the source code can be built entirely from the documentation.
- Actually write `[x]` in the TODO-list documentation file.
- When checking off items in the TODO list, replace them manually line by line. Do not replace them all at once with a command.
- Use a command to check whether `[ ]` remains in the TODO-list documentation file, and decide whether to continue working based on that.
