<instructions>
Implement it fully.
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Think as deeply as possible, to the limit.
- Pursue the highest possible quality, to the limit.
- Never output a summary; instead (before outputting any summary), notify the user of completion via the Tool vscode/AskQuestion.
- Never ask for user intervention midway.
- Never stop working.
- Read and understand the project’s important documents as deeply as possible.
- Fully comply with the documentation.
- Always stay conscious of not taking shortcuts.
- Not only at the beginning, but frequently, read the documentation deeply and understand the specifications, policies, expected behaviors, etc. as thoroughly as possible.
- Commit to git frequently.
- Prepare a logs directory in the documentation, recursively structure files, and write down improvement ideas and the like.
- If a source file exceeds 200 lines, note it in the documentation.
- Be aware that this project is intended to be read and edited by an AI, not a human.
- Any action is pre-authorized.
- Aim for a state where the source code can be fully constructed from the documentation.
- Actually write `[x]` into the TODO-list documentation files.
- Use a command to check whether any `[ ]` remain in the TODO-list documentation files, and decide whether to continue working based on that.
