# Doc Coverage: All Documentation Files

Back: [/docs/todo/README.md](/docs/todo/README.md)

## Scope

Complete direct-link index of every documentation file in the repository. Every `.md` file outside of `/docs/todo/` MUST appear here.

## Coverage files

| Part | Scope |
|---|---|
| [doc-coverage-1.md](doc-coverage-1.md) | design, guides, log, overview, policy, reference |
| [doc-coverage-2.md](doc-coverage-2.md) | spec: architecture, commands, editing |
| [doc-coverage-3.md](doc-coverage-3.md) | spec: editor, features, modes |
| [doc-coverage-4.md](doc-coverage-4.md) | spec: overview, scripting, technical, ui, ux + technical root |

## Rules

- Every documentation file MUST be directly linked with a checkbox.
- New documentation files MUST be added in the same change.
- All items are unchecked until verified by a reconstruction wave.
