# Doc Coverage: Full Direct-Link Checklist

Back: [/docs/todo/README.md](/docs/todo/README.md)

This checklist directly links every markdown document in the repository.

## Inventory

- Total tracked markdown docs: 446
- Parts: 5

## Parts

- [ ] [doc-coverage-1.md](doc-coverage-1.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-2.md](doc-coverage-2.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-3.md](doc-coverage-3.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-4.md](doc-coverage-4.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-5.md](doc-coverage-5.md)

## Regeneration Rule

- [x] regenerate part files after any docs add/remove/rename
- [ ] keep direct links absolute (`/docs/...` or `/README.md`)
- [ ] keep entries unchecked until verified in an implementation wave

## Verification Rule

- [x] no markdown document missing from part files
- [x] no stale links in part files
