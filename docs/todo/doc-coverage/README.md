# Doc Coverage: Full Direct-Link Checklist

Back: [/docs/todo/README.md](/docs/todo/README.md)

This checklist directly links every markdown document in the repository.

## Inventory

- [ ] Total tracked markdown docs (including root README): 444
- [ ] Parts: 5

## Parts

- [ ] [doc-coverage-1.md](doc-coverage-1.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-2.md](doc-coverage-2.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-3.md](doc-coverage-3.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-4.md](doc-coverage-4.md)
- [ ] [doc-coverage-5.md](doc-coverage-5.md)

## Regeneration Rule

- [x] regenerate part files after any docs add/remove/rename
- [x] keep direct links absolute (/docs/... or /README.md)
- [x] keep entries unchecked until implementation-wave verification

## Verification Rule

- [ ] no markdown document is missing from part files
- [ ] no stale links remain in part files
