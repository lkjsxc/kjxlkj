# Doc Coverage: /docs/log

Back: [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md)

## Scope
Covers documentation under `/docs/log/`.

Note: in some workflows, `/docs/log/` is intentionally pruned (only `/docs/log/README.md` remains). Historical context is summarized in `/docs/reference/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md`.

## Checklist (apply to every document listed)
- [ ] Read the document end-to-end.
- [ ] Extract MUST/SHOULD requirements into actionable TODO leaf(s) under `/docs/todo/current/`.
- [ ] If the document is under `/docs/spec/`, update:
  - `/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md`
  - `/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md` (when user-visible)
- [ ] Add or extend tests for any implemented behavior; record gaps as TODO leaves.
