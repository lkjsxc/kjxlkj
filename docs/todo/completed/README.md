# Completed Work

Back: [/docs/todo/README.md](/docs/todo/README.md)

## Purpose

Archive completed iteration TODOs and major documentation milestones.

## Archive Structure

- Iterations SHOULD be recorded as directories under `/docs/todo/completed/`.
- Each iteration directory MUST contain one `README.md` with:
  - completed tasks list
  - key documents updated (as links)
  - follow-up TODOs created
