# UX: Theming (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ux/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ux/README.md)

## Scope

Implement theming expectations as a user-facing behavior.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Theming:
  - [/docs/spec/ux/theming.md](/docs/spec/ux/theming.md)
- UI themes:
  - [/docs/spec/ui/themes.md](/docs/spec/ui/themes.md)

## Checklist

- [ ] Define theme model ownership and how themes affect rendering.
- [ ] Minimal slice: implement a small theme set with deterministic render tests.
- [ ] Full conformance: implement all theming rules and customization behaviors.
