Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ux/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ux/README.md)

## Scope

Implement the keybinding DSL and its interpretation rules.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Keybinding DSL:
  - [/docs/spec/ux/keybinding-dsl.md](/docs/spec/ux/keybinding-dsl.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define the DSL parse model and validation rules.
- [x] Minimal slice: implement a small DSL subset with deterministic tests.
- [x] Full conformance: implement the entire DSL as specified.
