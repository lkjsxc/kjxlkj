# UX: Keybindings (Iteration 35)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ux/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ux/README.md)

## Scope

Implement keybinding coverage and ensure it matches mode behavior and command surfaces.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Keybindings index:
  - [/docs/spec/ux/keybindings.md](/docs/spec/ux/keybindings.md)
- Keybinding sections:
  - [/docs/spec/ux/keybindings/README.md](/docs/spec/ux/keybindings/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- Keybindings subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/ux/keybindings/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/ux/keybindings/README.md)

## Checklist

- [ ] Follow the leader-key checklist:
  - [leader/README.md](leader/README.md)
- [ ] Define a keybinding coverage map tied to tests and conformance.
- [ ] Minimal slice: ensure all currently implemented keys are documented and tested.
- [ ] Full conformance: implement the full keybinding tables (or record limitations explicitly).
