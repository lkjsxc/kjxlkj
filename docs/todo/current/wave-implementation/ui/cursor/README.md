Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ui/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/ui/README.md)

## Scope

Implement cursor rendering rules, including interaction with selection, highlights, and overlays.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Cursor:
  - [/docs/spec/editing/cursor/README.md](/docs/spec/editing/cursor/README.md)
- Cursor customization:
  - [/docs/spec/features/ui/cursor-customization.md](/docs/spec/features/ui/cursor-customization.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define cursor shape/visibility in snapshots.
