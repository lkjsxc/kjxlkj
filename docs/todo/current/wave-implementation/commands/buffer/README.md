# Ex Commands: Buffer (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/commands/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/commands/README.md)

## Scope

Implement buffer listing, navigation, and arglist-related Ex commands.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Buffer commands index:
  - [/docs/spec/commands/buffer/README.md](/docs/spec/commands/buffer/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- Buffer commands subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/commands/buffer/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/commands/buffer/README.md)

## Checklist

### A. Placeholder scaffolding

- [ ] Define buffer identity, naming, and lifecycle semantics in core state.
- [ ] Define buffer list presentation rules (UI and command output).

### B. Minimal conformance slice

- [ ] Implement buffer listing and navigation minimal subset with tests.

### C. Full conformance

- [ ] Implement all buffer commands and arglist behaviors in the subtree.

### D. Conformance updates

- [ ] Update:
  - [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md)
  - [/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md](/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md) (when user-visible)
