# Ex Commands: Session (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/commands/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/commands/README.md)

## Scope

Implement session-related Ex commands and persistence behaviors (swap, undo persistence, autosave, recent files).

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Session commands index:
  - [/docs/spec/commands/session/README.md](/docs/spec/commands/session/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- Session commands subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/commands/session/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/commands/session/README.md)

## Checklist

### A. Placeholder scaffolding

- [ ] Define persistence boundaries and storage locations.
- [ ] Define recovery behavior and user-visible diagnostics.

### B. Minimal conformance slice

- [ ] Implement one persistence mechanism end-to-end with tests (as specified).

### C. Full conformance

- [ ] Implement all session commands and persistence behaviors in the subtree.

### D. Conformance updates

- [ ] Update:
  - [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md)
  - [/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md](/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md) (when user-visible)
