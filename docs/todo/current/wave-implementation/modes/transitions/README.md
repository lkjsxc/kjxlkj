# Modes: Transitions (Iteration 34)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/modes/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/modes/README.md)

## Scope

Implement mode transition rules and invariant enforcement across transitions.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Mode transitions:
  - [/docs/spec/modes/transitions.md](/docs/spec/modes/transitions.md)

## Checklist

### A. Placeholder scaffolding

- [ ] Define a single transition table/graph with explicit guards.

### B. Minimal conformance slice

- [ ] Implement a minimal transition set and tests covering cancellation and clamping rules.

### C. Full conformance

- [ ] Implement all transitions, including terminal-mode transitions when applicable.

### D. Conformance updates

- [ ] Update:
  - [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md)
