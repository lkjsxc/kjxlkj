# Technical: Testing (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/technical/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/technical/README.md)

## Scope

Implement the testing strategy as a normative part of the spec.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Spec testing:
  - [/docs/spec/technical/testing.md](/docs/spec/technical/testing.md)
- Engineering testing guidance:
  - [/docs/technical/testing/README.md](/docs/technical/testing/README.md)

## Checklist

- [ ] Establish deterministic unit/integration/E2E layers.
- [ ] Ensure E2E tests operate via terminal input streams (or headless equivalent as specified).
- [ ] Add regression tests for cursor/viewport/input latency invariants.
