# Editing: Operators (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/editing/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/editing/README.md)

## Scope

Implement operators, operator-pending behavior, and operator modifiers.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Operators index:
  - [/docs/spec/editing/operators/README.md](/docs/spec/editing/operators/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- Operators subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/editing/operators/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/editing/operators/README.md)

## Checklist

### A. Placeholder scaffolding

- [ ] Define operator grammar and parsing model.
- [ ] Define operator application to motions and text objects.

### B. Minimal conformance slice

- [ ] Implement a minimal operator set with deterministic tests (including edge cases).

### C. Full conformance

- [ ] Implement all operator behaviors, modifiers, and advanced operators in the subtree.

### D. Conformance updates

- [ ] Update:
  - [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md)
