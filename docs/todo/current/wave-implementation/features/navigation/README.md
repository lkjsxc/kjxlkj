# Features: Navigation (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md)

## Scope

Implement built-in navigation/indexing features.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Navigation features index:
  - [/docs/spec/features/navigation/README.md](/docs/spec/features/navigation/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- Navigation subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/navigation/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/navigation/README.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define index service contracts and UI surfaces.
- [x] Minimal slice: implement one navigation workflow end-to-end with tests.
- [x] Full conformance: implement all navigation feature documents.
- [x] Update conformance and limitations docs when user-visible.
