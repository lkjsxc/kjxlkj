# Features: UI Features (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md)

## Scope

Implement the UI feature layer (cursor customization, viewport, popups, notifications, statusline).

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- UI features index:
  - [/docs/spec/features/ui/README.md](/docs/spec/features/ui/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- UI features subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/ui/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/ui/README.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define feature state ownership and snapshot integration.
- [x] Minimal slice: implement one feature end-to-end with deterministic tests.
- [x] Full conformance: implement all UI feature documents.
- [x] Update conformance and limitations docs when user-visible.
