# Features: Editing Adjacent (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md)

## Scope

Implement built-in features that augment editing (but are not core motions/operators).

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Editing features index:
  - [/docs/spec/features/editing/README.md](/docs/spec/features/editing/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- Editing features subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/editing/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/editing/README.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define feature ownership and UI surfaces.
- [x] Minimal slice: implement one feature end-to-end with tests.
- [x] Full conformance: implement all editing-feature documents.
- [x] Update conformance and limitations docs when user-visible.
