# Features: Configuration (Iteration 34)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/features/README.md)

## Scope

Implement configuration features (themes, keybindings, options) as specified.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Config features index:
  - [/docs/spec/features/config/README.md](/docs/spec/features/config/README.md)

## Coverage traversal

- Config subtree:
  - [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/config/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/spec/features/config/README.md)

## Checklist

- [ ] Placeholder scaffolding: define config file format and load/apply boundaries.
- [ ] Minimal slice: implement one configuration axis end-to-end with tests.
- [ ] Full conformance: implement all config documents in the subtree.
- [ ] Update conformance and limitations docs when user-visible.
