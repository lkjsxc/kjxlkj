# Editor: Windows (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/editor/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/editor/README.md)

## Scope

Implement the window model (viewports, splits, tabs) and per-window options.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Windows:
  - [/docs/spec/editor/windows.md](/docs/spec/editor/windows.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define window identity, viewport, and option model.
- [x] Minimal slice: implement a single window with deterministic viewport follow and tests.
- [x] Full conformance: implement splits/tabs and all per-window behaviors in the spec.
- [x] Update conformance and limitations docs when user-visible.
