# Editor: Windows (Iteration 34)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/editor/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/editor/README.md)

## Scope

Implement the window model (viewports, splits, tabs) and per-window options.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Windows:
  - [/docs/spec/editor/windows.md](/docs/spec/editor/windows.md)

## Checklist

- [ ] Placeholder scaffolding: define window identity, viewport, and option model.
- [ ] Minimal slice: implement a single window with deterministic viewport follow and tests.
- [ ] Full conformance: implement splits/tabs and all per-window behaviors in the spec.
- [ ] Update conformance and limitations docs when user-visible. — done: conformance and limitations entries maintained with each batch
- [ ] Handoff gate added: practical multi-window usage is explicitly queued in [/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/next-iteration/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/next-iteration/README.md) and [/docs/todo/current/wave-verification/tests/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-verification/tests/README.md).
