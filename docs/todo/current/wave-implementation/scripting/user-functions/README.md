# Scripting: User Functions (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/scripting/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/scripting/README.md)

## Scope

Implement user-defined functions where the spec requires them, including invocation contexts.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- User functions:
  - [/docs/spec/scripting/user-functions.md](/docs/spec/scripting/user-functions.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define function registry and call boundary.
- [x] Minimal slice: implement one deterministic function call with tests.
- [x] Full conformance: implement all function behaviors described by the spec.
