# Scripting: Command-Line Completion (Iteration 34)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/scripting/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/scripting/README.md)

## Scope

Implement scriptable completion behaviors for the command line, as specified.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Command-line completion:
  - [/docs/spec/scripting/cmdline-completion.md](/docs/spec/scripting/cmdline-completion.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: define completion provider interfaces.
- [x] Minimal slice: implement one deterministic completion source with tests.
- [x] Full conformance: implement all completion behaviors described by the spec.
