# Architecture: Crate Topology (Iteration 34)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/architecture/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-implementation/architecture/README.md)

## Scope

Align the workspace crate topology with the canonical spec.

## Defining documents (direct, normative)

- Crate layout:
  - [/docs/spec/architecture/crates.md](/docs/spec/architecture/crates.md)
- Root layout constraint:
  - [/docs/policy/ROOT_LAYOUT.md](/docs/policy/ROOT_LAYOUT.md)

## Checklist

- [x] Placeholder scaffolding: ensure every required crate exists (stubs allowed).
- [x] Minimal slice: ensure a minimal end-to-end runtime compiles and tests run.
- [x] Full conformance: align module boundaries and dependencies to the spec topology.
- [x] Record and justify any deviations in `/docs/log/proposals/` and `/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md`.
