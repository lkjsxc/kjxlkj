# Reconstruction Phases

Back: [/docs/todo/current/README.md](/docs/todo/current/README.md)

Do not advance to the next phase while current phase has unchecked blockers.

## Phases

- [x] [phase-0-foundation.md](phase-0-foundation.md)
- [x] [phase-1-editor-core.md](phase-1-editor-core.md)
- [x] [phase-2-window-explorer-terminal.md](phase-2-window-explorer-terminal.md)
- [ ] [phase-3-i18n-wrap-ime.md](phase-3-i18n-wrap-ime.md)
- [ ] [phase-4-services-and-features.md](phase-4-services-and-features.md)
- [ ] [phase-5-hardening-release.md](phase-5-hardening-release.md)

## Phase Closure Rule

A phase may be checked complete only when:

- [ ] all phase tasks are checked
- [ ] all phase-required tests are passing with deterministic evidence
- [ ] conformance, limitations, and drift matrix are synchronized
