# Reconstruction Phases

Back: [/docs/todo/current/README.md](/docs/todo/current/README.md)

Do not advance while the current phase has unchecked blocker-critical items.

## Phases

- [ ] [phase-0-foundation.md](phase-0-foundation.md)
- [ ] [phase-1-editor-core.md](phase-1-editor-core.md)
- [ ] [phase-2-window-explorer-terminal.md](phase-2-window-explorer-terminal.md)
- [ ] [phase-3-i18n-wrap-ime.md](phase-3-i18n-wrap-ime.md)
- [ ] [phase-4-services-and-features.md](phase-4-services-and-features.md)
- [ ] [phase-5-hardening-release.md](phase-5-hardening-release.md)

## Phase Closure Rule

A phase may be marked complete only when:

- [ ] all phase tasks are checked
- [ ] all phase-required tests pass deterministically
- [ ] conformance, limitations, drift matrix, and TODO are synchronized
