# Phase 4: Services and Feature Completion

Back: [/docs/todo/current/phases/README.md](/docs/todo/current/phases/README.md)

## Scope

Complete service-backed feature surface beyond core editing.

## Tasks

- [ ] implement LSP service with completion and diagnostics
- [ ] implement Git service with status and diff surfaces
- [ ] implement indexing/finder service with deterministic queries
- [ ] implement syntax/highlighting path per spec
- [ ] close scaffold-only statuses in conformance for core feature domains

## Required Spec Links

- [ ] [/docs/spec/features/lsp/README.md](/docs/spec/features/lsp/README.md)
- [ ] [/docs/spec/features/git/README.md](/docs/spec/features/git/README.md)
- [ ] [/docs/spec/features/navigation/finder.md](/docs/spec/features/navigation/finder.md)
- [ ] [/docs/spec/features/syntax/README.md](/docs/spec/features/syntax/README.md)

## Required Tests

- [ ] domain integration tests for each implemented service path
- [ ] at least one E2E workflow per service feature family
- [ ] regression tests for every limitation closed in this phase
