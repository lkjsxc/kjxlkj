# Continue to the Next Iteration (Iteration 34)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/README.md)

## Purpose

Define the handoff into the next iteration so improvement can continue.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create an iteration marker (Iteration 35) by updating the current TODO index and wave titles.
- [ ] Carry forward unfinished tasks as explicitly deferred unchecked items.
- [ ] Start with a fresh reading pass on any documents modified in the prior iteration.
- [ ] If documentation was added/moved, ensure [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md) is regenerated and complete.
