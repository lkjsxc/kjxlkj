# Continue to the Next Iteration (Iteration 36)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/README.md)

## Purpose

Define the handoff into the next iteration so improvement can continue.

## Tasks

- [x] Create an iteration marker (Iteration 37) by updating the current TODO index and wave titles.
- [x] Carry forward unfinished tasks as actionable unchecked items in the next iteration.
- [x] If an item is intentionally deferred, do not leave it as an unchecked “future” box; instead:
  - record the deferral as a proposal under `/docs/log/proposals/`
  - add a linked implementation task in the next iteration
  - check off the deferral task in the completed iteration
- [x] Start with a fresh reading pass on any documents modified in the prior iteration.
- [x] If documentation was added/moved, ensure [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md) is regenerated and complete.
