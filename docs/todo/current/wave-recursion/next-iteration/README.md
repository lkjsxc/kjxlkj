# Continue to the Next Iteration (Standby)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/README.md](/docs/todo/current/wave-recursion/README.md)

## Purpose

Queue the next execution cycle after documentation hardening.

## Standby checklist

- [ ] Start next implementation iteration and execute unchecked boundary PTY E2E tasks.
- [ ] Re-run full verification gate after implementation updates.
- [ ] Regenerate `/docs/todo/doc-coverage/` if documentation topology changes.
- [ ] Split line-count-exempt reference docs into <=200-line topology and remove exceptions from policy/checker.
- [ ] Update conformance and limitations ledgers to match implemented behavior.
- [ ] Invoke `Ask` once the next iteration is fully complete and verification is green.
