# Recreate the TODO List (Iteration 32)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/README.md](/docs/todo/current/README.md)

## Purpose

Keep the work recursive by regenerating the current TODO list with:

- Newly discovered issues
- Newly added specification gaps
- Newly identified contradictions

## Rules

- The regenerated TODO list MUST still be recursively structured.
- The regenerated TODO list MUST keep the second-to-last item as “Recreate the TODO list”.
- The regenerated TODO list MUST create a new iteration directory under `/docs/todo/current/` only after completing the current iteration’s checklist.
