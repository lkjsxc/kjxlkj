# TODO: Verification

Back: [/docs/todo/current/README.md](/docs/todo/current/README.md)

## Gate 0: Requirement Inventory

- [x] Build or update a requirements matrix in `/docs/log/reconstruction/audits/`.
- [x] Assign requirement IDs mapped to exact `/docs/spec/...` links.
- [x] Mark each requirement as `verified`, `partial`, `scaffold-only`, or `unverified`.

## Gate 1: Implementation Reachability

- [x] Confirm each claimed feature is reachable from real runtime input paths.
- [x] Confirm no completion claim is based only on types or stubs.
- [x] Confirm dispatch wiring exists for each implemented command/key workflow.

## Gate 2: Deterministic Verification

- [x] Run targeted tests for touched domains.
- [x] Run full reconstructed verification gate from [/docs/reference/CI.md](/docs/reference/CI.md).
- [x] Capture result evidence in dated audit logs.

## Gate 3: Reference Synchronization

- [x] Update [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md) with evidence-backed status.
- [x] Update [/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md](/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md) for remaining gaps.
- [x] Update relevant sub-ledgers in [/docs/reference/conformance/README.md](/docs/reference/conformance/README.md).

## Gate 4: TODO Integrity

- [x] Mark checkboxes complete only when evidence exists.
- [x] Ensure no checked item conflicts with open limitations.
- [x] Ensure `/docs/todo/doc-coverage/` reflects current documentation topology.
