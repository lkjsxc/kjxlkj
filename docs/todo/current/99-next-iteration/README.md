# Continue to the Next Iteration (Iteration 33)

Back: [/docs/todo/current/README.md](/docs/todo/current/README.md)

## Purpose

Define the handoff into the next iteration so improvement can continue.

## Tasks

- Create an iteration marker (Iteration 34) by updating the current TODO index.
- Carry forward any unfinished tasks as explicitly deferred items.
- Start with a fresh reading pass on any documents modified in the prior iteration.
- If documentation was added/moved, ensure [/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md](/docs/todo/doc-coverage/README.md) is regenerated and complete.
