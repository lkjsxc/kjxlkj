## Inventory

- [ ] Extract all service-feature requirements into requirement matrix.

## Implementation

- [ ] Implement supervised service behavior and request/response wiring.
- [ ] Implement LSP, git, indexing/navigation, syntax, and config feature semantics.
- [ ] Ensure service failures are surfaced and recoverable per architecture contracts.

## Verification

- [ ] Add/refresh deterministic tests for service wiring and feature behavior.
- [ ] Record evidence in conformance and limitations ledgers.
