## Inventory

- [x] Extract all service-feature requirements into requirement matrix.

## Implementation

- [x] Implement supervised service behavior and request/response wiring.
- [x] Implement LSP, git, indexing/navigation, syntax, and config feature semantics.
- [x] Ensure service failures are surfaced and recoverable per architecture contracts.

## Verification

- [x] Add/refresh deterministic tests for service wiring and feature behavior.
- [x] Record evidence in conformance and limitations ledgers.
