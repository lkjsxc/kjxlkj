# Wave Program

Back: [/docs/todo/README.md](/docs/todo/README.md)

This multi-stage program defines full reconstruction end-to-end.

## Execution Rules

- [ ] execute stages in listed order only
- [ ] execute waves in each stage in listed order only
- [ ] do not check completion boxes without deterministic evidence
- [ ] prioritize correctness and user-visible behavior over convenience
- [ ] keep ledgers synchronized with wave status
- [ ] keep source directories near 12 direct children and split files before 200 lines

## Ordered Stages

- [x] Stage 00: Foundation Ingestion: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-00-foundation-ingestion/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-00-foundation-ingestion/README.md)

- [x] Stage 02: Editing and Modes: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-02-editing-and-modes/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-02-editing-and-modes/README.md)
- [x] Stage 03: Commands and Ranges: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-03-commands-and-ranges/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-03-commands-and-ranges/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 04: Window, Explorer, Terminal: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-04-window-explorer-terminal/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-04-window-explorer-terminal/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 05: Services and Features: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-05-services-and-features/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-05-services-and-features/README.md)

- [ ] Stage 07: Technical Hardening: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-07-technical-hardening/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-07-technical-hardening/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 08: Release and Ops: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-08-release-and-ops/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-08-release-and-ops/README.md)

## Program Exit

- [ ] all stage and wave files are completed with evidence
- [ ] continue to release ledger closure in [/docs/reference/RELEASE.md](/docs/reference/RELEASE.md)
