# Wave Program

Back: [/docs/todo/README.md](/docs/todo/README.md)

This program is a multi-stage, dozens-of-waves execution chain for full reconstruction.

## Global Wave Rules

- [ ] execute stages in listed order only
- [ ] execute waves in each stage in listed order only
- [ ] do not skip direct document-read checkboxes
- [ ] close correctness and reachability before optimization
- [ ] update reference ledgers in lock-step with TODO status
- [ ] treat every wave as evidence-gated, not assumption-gated
- [ ] if contradictions are found, downgrade ledgers immediately and continue
- [ ] maintain topology and file-size constraints during implementation

## Ordered Stages

- [ ] Stage 00: Foundation Ingestion: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-00-foundation-ingestion/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-00-foundation-ingestion/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 01: Architecture Core: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-01-architecture-core/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-01-architecture-core/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 02: Editing and Modes: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-02-editing-and-modes/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-02-editing-and-modes/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 03: Commands and Ranges: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-03-commands-and-ranges/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-03-commands-and-ranges/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 04: Window, Explorer, Terminal: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-04-window-explorer-terminal/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-04-window-explorer-terminal/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 05: Services and Features: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-05-services-and-features/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-05-services-and-features/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 06: UI, UX, and Scripting: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-06-ui-ux-and-scripting/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-06-ui-ux-and-scripting/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 07: Technical Hardening: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-07-technical-hardening/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-07-technical-hardening/README.md)
- [ ] Stage 08: Release and Ops: [/docs/todo/waves/stage-08-release-and-ops/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/stage-08-release-and-ops/README.md)

## Program Exit

- [ ] all stage readmes are fully checked
- [ ] all wave files are fully checked with deterministic evidence
- [ ] continue to inventory closure: [/docs/todo/inventory/README.md](/docs/todo/inventory/README.md)
