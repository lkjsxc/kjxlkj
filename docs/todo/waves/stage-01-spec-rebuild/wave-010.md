## Restructure Steps

- [ ] restructure-step S01-W010-01: scaffold crate topology required by [/docs/spec/architecture/crates.md](/docs/spec/architecture/crates.md)
- [ ] restructure-step S01-W010-02: wire runtime supervision boundaries from [/docs/spec/architecture/runtime.md](/docs/spec/architecture/runtime.md)
- [ ] restructure-step S01-W010-03: enforce workspace layout from [/docs/spec/architecture/source-layout.md](/docs/spec/architecture/source-layout.md)
- [ ] restructure-step S01-W010-04: enforce workspace manifest policy from [/docs/spec/architecture/workspace-manifest.md](/docs/spec/architecture/workspace-manifest.md)
- [ ] restructure-step S01-W010-05: enforce typed-language constraints from [/docs/spec/technical/type-safety.md](/docs/spec/technical/type-safety.md)

## Verification Hooks

- [ ] restructure-step S01-W010-V01: run architecture/type checks required by [/docs/spec/technical/testing.md](/docs/spec/technical/testing.md)
- [ ] restructure-step S01-W010-V02: verify deployability path remains compatible with [/docs/spec/architecture/deployment.md](/docs/spec/architecture/deployment.md)
