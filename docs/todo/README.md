## Recursive Wave Program

- [x] open [/docs/todo/waves/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/README.md)
- [x] execute stages and waves in order (Stage 00 through Stage 09)
- [x] do not mark work complete without deterministic evidence
- [x] synchronize reference ledgers with status changes

## Completion Gate

- [x] all stage and wave checklists are complete in order
- [x] all high-severity limitation rows are closed
- [x] acceptance tests in technical spec pass
- [x] release gate in [/docs/reference/RELEASE.md](/docs/reference/RELEASE.md) is satisfied
