# Reconstruction TODO

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

`/docs/todo/` is the execution contract for rebuilding `kjxlkj` from docs.

## Start Gate

- [ ] read [/README.md](/README.md)
- [ ] read [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)
- [ ] read [/docs/policy/README.md](/docs/policy/README.md)
- [ ] read [/docs/spec/README.md](/docs/spec/README.md)
- [ ] read [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md)
- [ ] read [/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md](/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md)
- [ ] read [/docs/reference/DRIFT_MATRIX.md](/docs/reference/DRIFT_MATRIX.md)
- [ ] read [/docs/spec/technical/testing.md](/docs/spec/technical/testing.md)

## Immediate Blocker Pack

- [ ] `LIM-RUNTIME-01` runtime bootstrap and deployment reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-API-01` API v1 implementation reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-WS-01` websocket realtime reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-UI-01` UX-focused frontend reconstruction

- [ ] `LIM-SEARCH-01` full-text search reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-DEL-01` user-reachable note deletion reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-ISSUE-GUARD-01` regression guards for recorded findings

## Recursive Wave Program

- [ ] open [/docs/todo/waves/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/README.md)
- [ ] execute stages and waves in order
- [ ] do not mark work complete without deterministic evidence
- [ ] synchronize reference ledgers with status changes

## Completion Gate

- [ ] all stage and wave checklists are complete in order
- [ ] all high-severity limitation rows are closed
- [ ] acceptance tests in technical spec pass
- [ ] release gate in [/docs/reference/RELEASE.md](/docs/reference/RELEASE.md) is satisfied
