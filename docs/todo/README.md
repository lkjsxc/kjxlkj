## Immediate Blocker Pack

- [ ] `LIM-RUNTIME-02` runtime bootstrap and crate topology reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-API-02` API implementation reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-WS-02` websocket realtime reconstruction
- [ ] `LIM-UI-02` workspace suite frontend reconstruction

## Recursive Wave Program

- [ ] open [/docs/todo/waves/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/README.md)
- [ ] execute stages and waves in order (Stage 00 through Stage 09)
- [ ] do not mark work complete without deterministic evidence
- [ ] synchronize reference ledgers with status changes

## Completion Gate

- [ ] all stage and wave checklists are complete in order
- [ ] all high-severity limitation rows are closed
- [ ] acceptance tests in technical spec pass
- [ ] release gate in [/docs/reference/RELEASE.md](/docs/reference/RELEASE.md) is satisfied
