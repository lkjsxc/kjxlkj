Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

Design rationale and decomposition notes for major behaviors.

## Authority

This directory is explanatory.

- It does not override `/docs/policy/`, `/docs/spec/`, `/docs/reference/`, or `/docs/todo/`.
- When design notes conflict with canonical docs, canonical docs win.
