Back: [README.md](README.md)

## Architecture

- Consider adding OpenTelemetry tracing spans for cross-service correlation
- Consider adding connection pooling metrics to health endpoint
- Consider adding rate limiting middleware as a reusable layer

## Frontend

- Consider adding service worker for offline draft persistence
- Consider adding keyboard shortcut overlay for discoverability
- Consider PWA manifest for mobile homescreen installation

## Documentation

- crates.md should be updated to match the web-server architecture in
  source-layout.md (currently describes legacy terminal-editor decomposition)
- Consider adding an architecture decision record (ADR) format
