# Policy

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

Operating invariants for documentation and reconstruction.

## Core Invariants

1. `/docs` is authoritative.
2. runtime may be absent in docs-only baseline.
3. completion claims require deterministic evidence.
4. TODO and reference ledgers must remain synchronized.

## Normative Policy Set

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [INSTRUCT.md](INSTRUCT.md) | session-level operating contract |
| [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) | execution gates and TODO scan rules |
| [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) | doc/source topology limits |
| [ROOT_LAYOUT.md](ROOT_LAYOUT.md) | root layout rules |
