# Reference Documentation

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

`/docs/reference/` is the canonical truth for verified current state.

## Authority

For state claims, use this order:

1. [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md)
2. [/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md](/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md)
3. [/docs/reference/DRIFT_MATRIX.md](/docs/reference/DRIFT_MATRIX.md)
4. [/docs/reference/CI.md](/docs/reference/CI.md)
5. [/docs/reference/RELEASE.md](/docs/reference/RELEASE.md)
6. [/docs/reference/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md](/docs/reference/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md)

`/docs/spec/` remains the target behavior contract.

## Snapshot (2026-02-13)

- All in Docs governance is active.
- Canonical value is documentation.
- Reconstruction TODO is in completed state with linked wave evidence.
- Runtime conformance is partially re-established for startup and health checks.
- Docker root artifacts are present and treated as synchronized derivatives.

## Synchronization Rule

Whenever state changes, update these in one logical change:

- `CONFORMANCE.md`
- `LIMITATIONS.md`
- `DRIFT_MATRIX.md`
- `RELEASE.md`
- `/docs/todo/README.md`
