# Plugin Equivalent Mapping (Target)

Back: [/docs/reference/README.md](/docs/reference/README.md)

Non-normative mapping from common Neovim plugin categories to `kjxlkj` built-ins.

Verified runtime status must always come from:

- [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md)
- [/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md](/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md)

## Target Mapping

| Plugin Category | `kjxlkj` Target Surface |
|---|---|
| file tree plugins | built-in explorer |
| fuzzy finder plugins | built-in finder/index surfaces |
| LSP setup/completion plugins | built-in LSP + completion services |
| syntax/tree plugins | built-in syntax and semantic highlighting |
| git gutter/status plugins | built-in git signs and status surfaces |
| terminal plugins | built-in terminal panes |
| surround/comment helpers | built-in editing helpers |
