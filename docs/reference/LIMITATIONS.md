## Entry Rules

Each limitation entry MUST include:

- link to expected behavior (`/docs/spec/...`)
- concise observed behavior statement
- deterministic evidence pointer
- concrete next action

## Lifecycle Rules

- Close or update limitations in the same change that modifies behavior.
- Do not remove a limitation without evidence that the gap is closed.
- If behavior is intentionally deferred, keep limitation open with dated rationale.
