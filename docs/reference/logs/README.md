# Reference Logs

Back: [/docs/reference/README.md](/docs/reference/README.md)

Structured, append-only evidence logs for reconstruction and hardening work.

## Directories

- [reconstruction/](reconstruction/README.md): dated execution logs and gate outcomes
- [audits/](audits/README.md): deterministic audits (line counts, policy checks)
- [improvements/](improvements/README.md): curated improvement proposals linked to backlog rows

## Rules

- Keep logs deterministic and command-backed.
- Keep entries under 200 lines per file.
- Mirror actionable outcomes in [/docs/reference/IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md](/docs/reference/IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md).
