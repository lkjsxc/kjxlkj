# 2026-02-14 Checklist Sync Notes

Back: [/docs/log/improvements/2026/README.md](/docs/log/improvements/2026/README.md)

## Improvement Ideas

- add `make docs-check` target for link-reachability and stale-checklist scans
- auto-generate doc-map checklists from file-system manifests to reduce manual
  edits
- enforce a lint rule that rejects contradictory TODO/reference state wording
- include `LONG_SOURCE_FILES` scan output in every closure audit

## Immediate Next Slice

Adopt deterministic docs-check scripts and wire them into the Stage 00 governance
wave execution pattern.
