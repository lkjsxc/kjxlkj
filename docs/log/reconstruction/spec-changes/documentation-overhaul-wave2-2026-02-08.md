# Spec Changes: Documentation Overhaul Wave 2 (2026-02-08)

Back: [/docs/log/reconstruction/spec-changes/README.md](/docs/log/reconstruction/spec-changes/README.md)

## Objective

Second documentation improvement wave. Goal: ensure documentation is complete enough for a full, non-MVP reconstruction by Claude Opus 4.5.

## Completed changes

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Render pipeline | Created [/docs/spec/architecture/render-pipeline.md](/docs/spec/architecture/render-pipeline.md) |
| Input decoding | Created [/docs/spec/architecture/input-decoding.md](/docs/spec/architecture/input-decoding.md) |
| Terminal VT100 | Created [/docs/spec/features/terminal/escape-parser.md](/docs/spec/features/terminal/escape-parser.md) |
| Thin spec expansion | 20+ spec files expanded with implementation-grade detail |
| Code block fixes | Removed non-Mermaid code blocks from 5 files |
| Doc coverage | Added new files to doc-coverage index |
| TODO updates | Added items for new specs |

## Constraints followed

- Documentation only: no source code changes
- All TODOs unchecked (ready for fresh reconstruction)
- No `../` in links
- No non-Mermaid code blocks
