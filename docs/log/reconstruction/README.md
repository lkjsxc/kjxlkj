# Reconstruction Log

Back: [/docs/log/README.md](/docs/log/README.md)

Wave-oriented records for spec hardening and rebuild readiness.

## Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [audits/README.md](audits/README.md) | Spec-code-test mismatch audits |
| [spec-changes/README.md](spec-changes/README.md) | Canonical spec change records |
| [testing-ideas/README.md](testing-ideas/README.md) | High-value future test plans |

## Cleanup Rule

Old wave notes should be deleted after required constraints are promoted into canonical docs and
traceable replacement records exist in this directory.
