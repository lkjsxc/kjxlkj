# Log

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)
Structured project log for implementation work, decisions, and audits.

## Purpose

This repository may be rebuilt from documentation (see “All in Docs”), so long-running history is treated as optional.

This directory is intentionally minimal: it may contain only this README in some workflows.

Historical context that used to live under `/docs/log/` is summarized in:

- [/docs/reference/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md](/docs/reference/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md)

## What to update instead of logs

When implementation is created or changed, update:

- [/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](/docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md) (what is implemented)
- [/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md](/docs/reference/LIMITATIONS.md) (user-visible gaps)
- [/docs/todo/current/README.md](/docs/todo/current/README.md) (next work)
