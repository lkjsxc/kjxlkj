# Documentation Log

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

`/docs/log/` stores temporary, non-canonical records only.

## Authority

- log files never override policy, spec, reference, or TODO documents
- when constraints are promoted into canonical docs, matching log entries are deleted

## Retention Rule

- keep only unresolved notes
- delete historical wave records after promotion
- avoid duplicate status narratives in log and reference ledgers

## Active Sections

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [audits/](audits/README.md) | unresolved audit notes only |
| [proposals/](proposals/README.md) | unresolved change proposals only |

## Current State (2026-02-11)

No unresolved log entries are active.
