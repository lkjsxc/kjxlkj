# Documentation Log

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

`/docs/log/` stores temporary, non-canonical records only.

## Authority

Log files never override policy, spec, reference, or TODO documents.

## Retention Rule

- promote necessary constraints into canonical docs immediately
- delete historical records after promotion
- keep only active, unresolved notes

## Sections

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [audits/](audits/README.md) | unresolved audits only |
| [proposals/](proposals/README.md) | unresolved proposals only |
| [reconstruction/](reconstruction/README.md) | active temporary reconstruction notes only |

## Current State

No active historical records are retained.
