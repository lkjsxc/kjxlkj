# Documentation Log

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

`/docs/log/` stores non-canonical records used to support reconstruction quality.

## Contents

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [audits/](audits/README.md) | Topology/compliance audits |
| [proposals/](proposals/README.md) | Proposed improvements not yet promoted to canonical docs |
| [reconstruction/](reconstruction/README.md) | Wave-specific spec sync, testing ideas, and mismatch audits |

## Hygiene Rules

- Promote durable requirements into `/docs/spec/` or `/docs/policy/`.
- Keep logs concise and evidence-based.
- Delete stale historical records once promoted to canonical docs.
- Avoid contradictory status claims between logs and `reference` ledgers.
