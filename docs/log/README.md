# Documentation Log

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

This directory stores non-canonical records that support iterative reconstruction.

Canonical requirements remain under `/docs/spec/` and `/docs/policy/`.

## Contents

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [proposals/](proposals/) | Open proposals not yet promoted to canonical specs |
| [audits/](audits/) | Audit records tied to verification waves |
| [reconstruction/](reconstruction/) | Structured records for spec hardening, test ideas, and consistency audits |

## Record hygiene

When a historical record becomes stale:

1. Move required constraints into canonical docs.
2. Keep only concise trace records.
3. Delete obsolete detailed logs that can contradict current specs.
