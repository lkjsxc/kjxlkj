# Documentation Log

Back: [/docs/README.md](/docs/README.md)

`/docs/log/` stores unresolved temporary notes only.

## Authority

- log files never override policy, spec, reference, or TODO documents
- when constraints are promoted into canonical docs, matching log entries are deleted

## Retention Rule

- keep only unresolved notes
- do not keep historical progress narratives here
- avoid duplicate status claims across log and reference ledgers

## Current State (2026-02-12)

Historical progress logs were removed after promotion into canonical docs.
