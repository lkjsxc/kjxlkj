# Proposals

Back: [/docs/log/README.md](/docs/log/README.md)

## Purpose

Store improvement proposals that are not yet canonical specification.

Each proposal MUST:

- link to the defining spec documents (or the spec gaps)
- link to the TODO leaf that will implement it
- define acceptance criteria and a test strategy
- identify user-visible impacts and whether limitations must be updated
