# Proposal: Web-Server Product Pivot

Back: [/docs/log/proposals/README.md](/docs/log/proposals/README.md)

## Date

2026-02-12

## Decision

Adopt a full product pivot from CLI terminal editor to web application server
for notes and records, while keeping the All-in-Docs governance model.

## Scope

- Hard-replace canonical docs with web-server behavior.
- Use Rust + Actix Web + Tokio + PostgreSQL.
- Use single compose service container running DB + app.

## Rationale

- Align product with requested delivery model.
- Keep deterministic docs-first execution discipline.
- Define API-first contracts for web and multi-device usage.

## Follow-Up

Execution is tracked in [/docs/todo/waves/README.md](/docs/todo/waves/README.md).
