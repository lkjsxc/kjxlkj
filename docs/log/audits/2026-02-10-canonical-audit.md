# Canonical Audit (2026-02-10)

Back: [/docs/log/audits/README.md](/docs/log/audits/README.md)

## Scope

Documentation hardening for reconstruction reliability.

## Promoted Into Canonical Docs

- terminal as first-class window and launch wiring requirements
- explorer launch/split wiring requirements
- `a` vs `A` vs `i` cursor semantics and shifted key normalization
- Japanese IME composition and leader-isolation requirements
- on-screen long-line wrapping rules across views
- phase-based TODO model with anti-shortcut gates
- reference drift matrix and concise limitations ledger
- source layout blueprint with around-12 fan-out target

## Deleted Historical Records

- old wave TODO files
- old wave logs and reconstruction notes
- stale proposal history already promoted to canonical docs
- stale audit snapshots superseded by this baseline

## Verification

- directory fan-out policy violations addressed by log and TODO cleanup
- non-mermaid fenced-code violations reduced by removing stale files and
  rewriting regex lookaround spec
